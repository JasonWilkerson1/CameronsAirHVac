- Optional: Node.js or Python for local server setup.

### Installation
1. **Download the Project**:
   - Clone or download the repository: `git clone <repository-url>` (if hosted on GitHub) or download the ZIP from the source.
   - Extract the files to a local directory (e.g., `CameronsAirHVac`).

2. **Run Locally**:
   - **Using VS Code with Live Server**:
     - Install VS Code and the Live Server extension.
     - Open the project folder in VS Code.
     - Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" to view at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
   - **Using Python**:
     - Navigate to the project folder in a terminal: `cd CameronsAirHVac`.
     - Run `python -m http.server 8000` (Python 3).
     - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

3. **Verify**:
   - Ensure all assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly.
   - Test responsiveness by resizing the browser.

## Customization

  - Add alt text to images (e.g., `alt="HVAC technician in Olive Branch, MS"`).
